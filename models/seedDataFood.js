        recipe: "On two plates, add a handful of Arugula (2 cups) to each one. Evenly divide the Red Onion (1/2) and Cherry Tomatoes (8) on top of the arugula. Season with Sea Salt (1 pinch) and Freshly Ground Black Pepper (1 pinch) and set aside. Season Salmon Fillets (2) with Sea Salt (1 pinch) and a generous pinch of Lemon Pepper (1 pinch) seasoning. Compress the seasonings with your hands so they stick to the salmon. Heat a frying pan with a medium-high heat and add Extra-Virgin Olive Oil (2 Tbsp). After 2 minutes, add the fillets of salmon seasoned side down. Using a spatula, push down on each fillet for about 30 seconds. Then after 3 minutes, flip the salmon fillets to cook the other side. Cook for a total of 6 minutes, then remove the salmon from the heat. Add 1 fillet to each plate with the salad, garnish with a couple of slices of Lemons (to taste) and add a drizzle of Extra-Virgin Olive Oil (1 Tbsp) to the salad before serving.",
